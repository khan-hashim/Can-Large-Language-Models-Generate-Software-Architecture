The system should be a web-based community meeting management platform. The system should let users register in different roles such as Member or Administrator. The system should allow registered users to create and sustain interest-driven meeting groups. It should allow a newly registered member to propose a meeting group. The system should allow users with administrator role to see new meeting group proposals, and let them approve or reject the meeting group proposals. The system should allow users in approved meeting groups to be able to create meetings with details such as capacity limits, guest allowances, and optional event fees.  A dedicated payment subsystem should process meeting group payments as well as per-meeting fee transactions, enforcing that only groups with valid payments can continue creating meetings.
