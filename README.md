This repository contains the chats for our work "Use of Large Language Models in Generating Software Architecture"

There are two main parts to this repository:

Single-Pass-Generation - contains results for all the both systems for single pass architecture generation for all prompt and model combinations including the generated architectures and the result csv files.
Two-Pass-Iterative Refinement - contains results for all the both systems for two-pass iterative architecture generation for all prompt and model combinations including the generated architectures and the result csv files.
